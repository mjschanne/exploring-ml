# Exploring ML

This contains the work I did going through the following two blog posts. For each blog post, I rewrote the post as a Jupyter noteback with the code as runnale and also rewrote the code in a separate notebook which I annotated in the code. Rather than making my annotations markdown I just did it in the code so that it was simpler to make my comments on a per line basis. I found this exercise extremely helpful in better understanding what these tutorials were really showing me.

If you're new to Jupyter labs like I was when I started this endeavor, I found this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) really helpful.
